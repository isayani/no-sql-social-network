## Description

Telepathy is a social network backend (API) where users can create a friend list, share their thoughts, and react to their friends' thoughts! This API uses Express.js for routing, MongoDB as the database, and Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) library. This API also uses the native Javascript ``Date`` object and moment.js to format timestamps. To learn more about Telepathy API, read throught the documentation below.
